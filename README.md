If/else statement is used to control the flow of the program.
The ternary operation is the shorthand way to write an if/else statement.
For example: 
return x < 10 ? 1 : 2;
The condition is x < 10.
The "?" operator is called the ternary operator.
If the condition is true, it returns 1, and if the condition is false then it returns 2.
